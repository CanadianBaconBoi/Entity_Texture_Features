### This mod is completely Optifine format compatible!!!!

- It supports all optifine Emissive Texture Resource-packs

---
## The Guide:

- Emissive textures allow parts of a mob / entity's texture to glow as in the above image

- Emissive textures must be in the same folder as the texture it is glowing over and must be named like (TextureName#.png)
*(with "#" being the suffix set by the topmost optifine format resourcepack, it 
will otherwise default to "_e" meaning the file name should be (TextureName_e.png)*

- Elytra & Tridents support emissive textures as of [V2.3.0]

- Player Skin Features support emissive textures, see [Player Skin Features Guide](SKINS.md)

---
## Example Emissive Textures
<img src="format_example.png" alt="img" width="650"/>

- The example image above shows red glowing eyes for the texture *"zombie3.png"*
- Emissives are applied after randomised textures they must contain the same number system as the random files they apply too  
  *(e.g "zombie_e.png" will not apply to "zombie3.png" but "zombie3_e.png" will)*
