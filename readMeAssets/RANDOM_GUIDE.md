This mod is completely optifine format compatible!!!!  
Random textures are applied to each mob on the client-side  
*(based on it's UUID, meaning that mob will always have the same random texture unless texture packs are 
changed, this will even be the same between players if they have the same packs.)*

Random textures **must** either be in the same folder as the vanilla texture or one of the optifine format
folders such as *"optifine/random/entity"* or *"optifine/mob"*, and must be named like *(TextureName#.png with # 
being any number ideally starting from either 1 or 2, (if 1.png does not exist it will use the vanilla 
texture, the vanilla texture can also be manually called by using the number 0)*
A *"TextureName.properties"* file can be placed alongside these random textures to determine special cases 
for different random textures to be selected, this properties file must support the optifine format and if 
one isn't present the game will instead pick randomly from the available random textures present.
This mod supports **ALL** the settings that may be used in the properties file.
The properties files functions just as it does with optifine and if a specific entity does not match any of 
the conditions in the properties file it will default to the vanilla texture.

- The example image above shows that any zombie in a desert will have a 10/17 chance of using "zombie1.png"
- it also shows that any zombie not in a (desert,plains,jungle,nether) biome and is named "John" will always 
use texture "zombie3.png"
- it also shows that any zombie in a taiga biome, without the above names from the previoues category, and 
standing at y-level 45 will be texture "zombie1.png"
- "zombie3.png" also has an emissive texture "zombie3_e.png", that will make it's eyes glow red

Certain conditions in the properties file will update the mobs texture when changed, these are 
*("name", "profession", "collarColors", "baby", "health")*.
The other conditions such as "biomes" will only apply on first spawn / load.  
*(If they do not update (e.g baby doesn't grow into adult texture) you can force a refresh on a mob by 
right clicking it or reloading the game/resourcepacks)*
Entities with multiple textures like Wolves should have the same amount of ranom variant textures for 
each texture variant
Tridents support custom textures, as of *[V2.3.0]*, a trident item named *"Bobby's Trident"* will use the 
texture *"trident_bobbys_trident.png"*

If a custom mushroom texture is placed in *"minecraft/textures/entity/cow/red_mushroom.png"* or 
*"minecraft/textures/entity/cow/brown_mushroom.png"*, it will overwrite the mushrooms on the back
of the respective mooshroom.
